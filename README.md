# Number Guessing Game
## Requirements
 - Your script should randomly generate a number that users have to guess

 - When you run your script, you should prompt the user for a username with Enter your username:, and take a username as input. Your database should allow usernames of at least 22 characters

 - If that username has been used before, it should print Welcome back, <username>! You have played <games_played> games, and your best game took <best_game> guesses., with <username> being a users name from the database, <games_played> being the total number of games that user has played, and <best_game> being the fewest number of guesses it took that user to win the game

 - If the username has not been used before, you should print Welcome, <username>! It looks like this is your first time here.

 - The next line printed should be Guess the secret number between 1 and 1000: and input from the user should be read

 - Until they guess the secret number, it should print It's lower than that, guess again: if the previous input was higher than the secret number, and It's higher than that, guess again: if the previous input was lower than the secret number. Asking for input each time until they input the secret number.

 - If anything other than an integer is input as a guess, it should print That is not an integer, guess again:

 - When the secret number is guessed, your script should print You guessed it in <number_of_guesses> tries. The secret number was <secret_number>. Nice job!
